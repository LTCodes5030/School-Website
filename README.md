# School-Website
A website for CTE students enrolled in the Electronics, Robotics, and Programming course at Kent's Theodore Roosevelt High School.
It's still currently in development. As of now, I consider it to be in beta, and the first release will be V 1.0.0.
NOTE: It has been optimized for portability. If any issues arise, contact me at 301765@kentschools.net.

				<h1>Programming Languages</h1>
				<p>When it comes to programming, nothing is more important than choosing a programming language. While there are too many to talk about in detail, we have decided to pick four of the most widely recognized programming languages; C++, Python, HTML, and Javascript.</p>
					<article>
						<h2>C++</h2>
							<p>Created in 1985, C++ is by far one of the most widely recognised programming languages. C++ was made by Danish Computer Scientist Bjarne Stroustrup when trying to make a better version of C. which was originally was called "C with Classes". The name C++ was later created from the combination of C and the <code>++</code> increment operater. This new version of C included classes, virtual functions, constants, and the new function notation written <code>//like this.</code></p>

						<h2>HTML</h2>
							<p>In 1980, Tim Berners-Lee, a contracted physicist at <abbr title=" European Organization for Nuclear Research">CERN</abbr>, proposed ENQUIRE, the first prototype of what we know as <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. HTML is a web based markup language that is used to make creative and complex website, while still allowing people to pick it up easily. As a matter of fact, this site, in conjuction with CSS, is made with HTML.</p>

							<p>Reverse engineered out of Mosaic's web browser, JavaScript, or JS, was released in 1995 by Microsoft, which allowed for Java like code to be executed flawlessly in the browser</p>
